## To contribute:
I'm trying adopt a multi-tenary database implementation. In case you don't know what that means, simply put; I'm trying to have more that one database connections for the application.
One for products, another for customer details. Preference is MongoDB for products which has already been implemented and Firebase for customers/users. Just for the fun of itðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
Frontend contribution are also welcome ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
